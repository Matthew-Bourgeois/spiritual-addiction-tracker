      <h2>About the Spiritual Addiction Tracker</h2>

      <p>
        This app was created to help individuals battling spiritual addiction — not just to substances or habits,
        but to destructive patterns like lust, pride, envy, wrath, gluttony, greed, and sloth.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's a safe space for reflection, growth, and restoration. Whether you’re overcoming temptation,
        recovering from a fall, or striving to walk more closely with Christ, this tool supports you in:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>📖 Journaling your spiritual battles and victories</li>
        <li>🙏 Submitting reflections and receiving Bible-based encouragement</li>
        <li>🎯 Setting spiritual goals like prayer, fasting, and Bible study</li>
        <li>📈 Tracking growth and building holy habits over time</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        More than a habit tracker, this is a faith tool grounded in Scripture. It’s here to remind you that no matter
        how far you’ve fallen, God’s grace is always greater.
      </p>

        This app also points to the ultimate truth: salvation is not earned by perfection — it's received by believing
        in the One who is perfect.
      </p>

        “For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish
        but have eternal life.” — John 3:16
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’ve never received Jesus, let this moment be your turning point. He’s not waiting for you to be perfect —
        just to say yes.
